  <h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Shrayes Mudvari</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The main goal of this website is to build a better online presence for 100SMILES Dental Care. It focuses on a few
    key things:</p>
  <p>To make it easier for patients to book their appointments online from home.<br> → This way, people can save time
    and do not have to call or visit just to make a booking. Having this online system can also help increase the number
    of appointments over time.</p>
  <p>To give patients our contact details so they can easily reach out to us or share them with others.<br> → It is
    really important that patients can contact us anytime, so being available online 24/7 helps a lot.</p>
  <p>To help patients get to know our clinic, our services, and any new updates or announcements.<br> → Staying
    connected online is great for both us and the patients. They can learn about what we offer without even coming to
    the clinic.</p>
  <p>To make the website simple and easy to use for people of all ages.<br> → Our goal is to make sure everyone, young
    or old, can use the site without any trouble.</p>
  <p>To introduce our team members to patients.<br> → This helps patients feel more comfortable and familiar with the
    people who will be looking after them before they even visit.</p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p> It is very important to know if the website is working as we planned , for that evaluating the outputs is most.
    Some ways we can do it :</p>

  <p>Track the number of appointments booked <br>
    ->By this we can know if the website is helping the existing patients and also helping to bring new ones </p>

  <p>Does the patients explore our webpages or not<br>
    ->It is good to make sure that the patients are getting what we aim to offer them from our online platform</p>

  <p>Patient's reviews from our services and the feedbacks<br>
    ->Helpful for both new patients and us to fill the holes in our facility.Also the existing one can keep their words.
